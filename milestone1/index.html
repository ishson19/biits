        <h3>Problem & Solutions</h3>
        <p>
          The goal of our project is to create an educational web application to teach kids with autism spectrum
          disorder (ASD) about colors. Games make learning fun, motivates kids, and helps them pay attention and stay
          focused on the subject. Educational games also encourage students to learn in their own environment. There are
          many websites that promote online learning games, but few of them cater specifically for children with autism.
          Autistic children are often hypersensitive to sensory input, which makes sensory overload more likely. Some
          common symptoms of sensory overload include difficulty focusing due to competing sensory input, irritability,
          restlessness and discomfort, stress, fear, anxiety, and urge to shield eyes from the sensory input. With
          competing sensory input, an individual will feel as though they are stuck and do not know what to focus on
          [1]. Because autistic children generally have trouble identifying colors, it is important to develop an
          environment where they do not feel overwhelmed by color schemes [2].
        </p>
        <p>
          We are creating a web application that is soothing and encourages them to learn without overwhelming them. The
          main color scheme of the website will be simplistic and only use a few colors with low intensity in order to
          not discourage the kids. One game we will make is a color game that presents kids with autism a forum where
          they can learn to distinguish between colors. The game will encourage these kids to pick the correct color
          asked of them without excessive distractions such as too many bright colors on the screen or constantly moving
          flashy objects that could be visually straining. The game will also reward correct answers as positive
          reinforcement is especially effective for kids with autism. This game can be beneficial because it gives kids
          with autism a productive learning environment that encourages them to learn and focus without burdening them.
        </p>

      <div>
        <h3>Problems with Existing Solutions</h3>
        <p>From our experience searching online, it is clear there are few sites catered specifically to autistic
          children's use. Many sites will have resources to help autistic kids in person, or have print-outs to use with
          the child. There are not many that prioritize online games specifically for helping autistic kids learn. There
          are countless game sites online, and some built for teaching young children. However, after extensive
          searching there was exactly one site dedicated to helping autistic kids that was free (autismgames.com.au). It
          had five games, none of which related to color. The games were frustratingly slow and did not have clear
          instructions. After exploring the site, we realized that the site just aggregated games from a different site
          that did not mention autism, and didn’t even have a game for each category represented. In general, there are
          very few free interactive ways to teach children with ASD about colors online.
        </p>
        <p>While creating an educational environment for children with ASD, it is vital to keep color schemes in mind.
          The main pages of the site we found actually does a decent job of avoiding overstimulation. This is one of the
          most important considerations in design, as it is the main problem with most educational and game sites.
          However, the design should be aesthetically pleasing and interesting. The green, grey, and white design of the
          <a href="http://autismgames.com.au">site</a> does not foster creativity or healthy excitement. We must find a
          balance between peaceful, soothing
          designs and fun designs that will excite children. Essentially, we want to avoid being too boring or too
          flashy.
        </p>

      <div>
        <h3>Users</h3>
        <p>
          The primary users that our application interacts with is young
          children diagnosed with autism. The target age group are children too
          young for kindergarten, with a typical age range of 2 to 5 years.
          Since the differences between high functioning and low functioning
          individuals are not as pronounced at a younger age, we aim to make the
          website cater to both groups. In addition to this, children diagnosed
          with autism are highly encouraged to learn through visual means at an
          early age to build a foundation of knowledge. This age group is
          primarily limited to being users that would use their parent or
          guardian’s iPad or mobile phone to interact with the website through
          its touch screen interface. These mobile users may be in their own
          homes, pre-K, or other childcare facilities when using the app.
          Children that are not on the spectrum may not fully benefit from this
          app, but it can provide them with a visual focused alternative to
          learning the provided topics and achieving developmental milestones
          common to every individual. Gaining access to this app from this user
          would require it to be initially accessed from a different user group,
          typically their parent, guardian, or childcare worker.
        </p>
        <p>
          The second set of users are parents or guardians of the children
          interacting with the app. These individual’s primary interaction with
          the website is viewing the child’s progress in a topic area. These
          individuals are capable of accessing the website through desktops or
          laptops on top of mobile devices. Due to this, the application must be
          responsive to both desktops and various sizes of mobile devices.
          Online education websites for children with autism primarily run on
          subscription or payment plans, but this application is catered to
          families that are in low income areas. While geographic location of
          these families is not a notable factor in identifying users, there are
          certain economic status conditions that may be required. Families or
          childcare providers are financially expected to have access to a
          mobile device. This, coupled with the possible low hardware
          specifications in low income areas, require a low resource intensive
          model.
        </p>
        <p>
          Notable groups that this web app does not cater to is older and more
          mature audiences, individuals that have a proper understanding of the
          materials being taught, and individuals that are color blind. For the
          first two, the primary focus of the app is to target younger
          individuals with autism that have little knowledge of the topics
          presented. In regard to color blind individuals, the colors chosen are
          optimized for the hyper-sensitive nature that autism presents within
          children.
        </p>
        <p>
          This target group is appropriate as it focuses our app toward a
          specific demographic that takes into account age, technical
          understanding, economic standing, and point of access. While our
          primary demographic is children, we consider the perspective of others
          around them such as their parents, guardians, or other childcare
          workers. We also understood the limited scope of users for our project
          and identified that this project may not be suitable for all visitors.
          Children not on the spectrum may not fully benefit from the lessons or
          teaching methods provided, but these users can see this application
          more as an alternative style to teaching that is more visual than
          textual.

        <h3>Task Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          

          <br>

          The users will be young children, specifically geared towards children 2-5 years old who are diagnosed with
          autism. The application is simple and provides productive learning experience for this target group as studies
          have shown early intervention is optimal for this age group. By using simple benchmarks and milestones, young
          children will benefit from the application. The application can be used on a smartphone, tablet, or desktop
          computer and will require secure internet connection at the device’s location. The application will likely be
          used at home or school. Low-income families can benefit from this application as the application will be free
          and accessible on a variety of devices. <br>

        </p>
        <p>
          The application, where the child will complete their tasks, must be easy and simple to navigate. Since the
          application is aimed for autistic children, the application should avoid having bright colors, flashing
          objects, and other distracting UI.
        </p>

        <h3>Implications</h3>
        <p>
          From our research, we learned that in order to cater to the needs of our target users we need to avoid color
          palettes that overload sensory inputs. Our research regarding the sensitivity of sensory input within autistic
          children has shown that even the slightest stimulation in certain colors, visuals, auditory sounds, and other
          sensations may be disruptive and anxiety inducing for these children. Additionally, based on further research
          and numerous experiments conducted by professional doctors in the field, autistic children can be motivated to
          learn if provided with consistent rewards to help encourage progress. When designing our application, we have
          to consider avoid flashy, moving objects and have a reward system/incentives to keep the kids encouraged to
          learn[3].
          Based on interviews with special needs teachers, we were able to learn that various users of this target group
          respond to all colors differently on a spectrum. Some children may love certain colors at high intensity, and
          others may find those colors to be blinding and distracting. It is critical that we create capabilities for
          the users/parents to mute or increase the intensity of certain colors presented on the website, as well as
          modify the color scheme to suit the child’s own preferences. This can also work as an “incentive” for the
          child. Our final goal is to be able to implement simple navigation given the target/age group to help with the
          overall experience of the application, while fostering independence.
