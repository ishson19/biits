            <h3>Balloon Game</h3>
            <h5>Colors</h5>
            <img src="../public/balloon.PNG" class="center-pic"></img>
            <p>
                The initial design that we had was to implement a simple selection game where the user would choose the
                item by tapping/clicking on it. The decision was made to focus on educating the user about colors with
                this implementation. Since children with ASD react more positively to pastel colors with lower
                luminance,
                it was decided to split each color into 3 different levels; soft, medium, and strong. As the user
                progresses,
                they are slowly introduced to stronger colors with a higher variation in colors viewable at once. The
                other
                challenge introduced with this game at higher difficulties is movement of each balloon, and while the
                user is
                introduced to slow consistent movement, the level of movement does not have a radical increase due to
                its
                level of discomfort to the user.
            </p>
            <p>
                The primary advantage of this design could be implemented with the majority of topics we wish to teach.
                The
                simplistic gameplay interaction allowed the game’s challenge to progress at a consistent rate without
                overwhelming
                the user.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>Shape Game</h3>
            <h5>Shapes</h5>
            <img src="../public/shapes.PNG" class="center-pic"></img>
            <p>
                In the shapes game, children learn the following elementary shapes: star, cicle, square, and triangle.
                Other shapes
                may be added to higher levels, depending on the success rate following these initial shapes, and the
                child’s proclivity
                to succeed with more difficult shapes. The objective of this game is to be able to correctly place a
                shape into the
                “shape box” marked by an outline of a specific shape, i.e. a triangle. The child must then correctly
                choose the triangle
                shape from an assortment of given shapes, and drag it to the location of the outline on the “shape box”.
                Auditory responses
                follow after successful and unsuccessful attempts, which can either be “correct”, or “try again”, marked
                by green and red
                colors respectively. This also helps build associations that the color green is typically used for
                correct answers whereas
                red colors are used for incorrect answers. Some strengths of this design are that children will be able
                to understand and
                learn various shapes one at a time, and make sense of the shapes pictographically. However, potential
                drawbacks can be
                assessing their skills in different environments, since the game is a consistent environment which can
                become predictable
                and eventually plateau the learning curve once the child has reached mastery of certain fundamental
                shapes. Additionally,
                the rewarding system is still evolving; however, for this game in particular, it is possible that the
                auditory reward of
                “good job” may not be enough for the child.

            <h3>Maze Game</h3>
            <h5>Following Directions</h5>
            <img src="../public/maze.PNG" class="center-pic"></img>
            <p>
                In this mini game children are presented with directions to help a character on screen get home. The
                game presents a path
                from a character to a house, and the user is asked to follow a sequence of steps to help the character
                get to the house.
            </p>
            <p>
                When doing our research, we found out that children with autism often find it difficult to follow
                instructions and require
                many prompts to successfully complete a task. When moving to different locations these difficulties are
                apparent. Since
                kids with autism find online games engaging because of the audio and visual aspects, this game
                incorporates clear and
                easily understandable graphics and some interesting sounds would help autistic children learn to follow
                instructions and
                find a path.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>Design Decisions</h3>
            <p>
                We chose this color scheme because we learned children with autism prefer duller colors with low
                luminance. We also wanted
                to make the game simple because our target audience is young, which is why navigating through the game
                only requires
                taps/clicks with lots of instructions. Our balloon game also only requires taps/clicks, but this game
                differs from the
                colors game because unlike the colors which has mutually exclusive levels, this game is a continuous
                process which has
                an obvious goal. We created this option to explore whether kids prefer a discrete or continuous game.
                This game essentially
                evolved from the colors game to incorporate some more complex concepts that the users may like. Some
                other design decisions
                for this game include presenting the directions as well as the graphical directional panel for users so
                that they are encouraged
                to follow directions and stay familiar with common directional concepts such as ‘go left’, ‘go right’,
                ‘go up’, ‘go down’ with
                images. The character also moves closer to the house (goal) as the user clicks the correct choice
                because we wanted to engage
                the user with appealing visual aspects and a sense of accomplishment. The user is also motivated through
                constant feedback
                though positive messages and graphics.
